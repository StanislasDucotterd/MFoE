# Inverse Problems

To generate the simulated measurements:

1. Uncompress the `val_data` and `test_data` folders.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   python get_data.py
   ```

Because of the Gaussian noise and the MRI experiment which includes randomly generated sampling masks, the measurements you obtain may differ from those in the paper. If you require the exact measurements used in the paper, they are available upon request.
